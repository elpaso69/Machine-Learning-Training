# Machine-Learning-Training-

In this repository, I go through a NLP, ANN, CNN excercises. 

First is NLP, where I convert data from the Restaurant_Reviews.tsv using the nltk package in Python. 
Using the Naive Bayes Classifier we look at sentiment of restauurant reviews. 

Negative reviews are denoted as 0 
Positive reviews are denoted as 1 

We train the model to see how well it can predict positive and negative reviews in the test set. Using the confusion matrix to determine the accuracy of prediction.

Second is ANN, 

Third is CNN,
