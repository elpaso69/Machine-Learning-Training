# Machine-Learning-Training-

In this document I go through a NLP training excercise to convert data from the Restaurant_Reviews.tsv using the nltk package in Python. 
Using the Naive Bayes Classifier we look at sentiment of restauurant reviews. 

Negative reviews are denoted as 0 
Positive reviews are denoted as 1 

We train the model to see how well it can predict positive and negative reviews in the test set. Using the confusion matrix to determine the accuracy of prediction.
