# Machine-Learning-Training-

In this repository, I go through a NLP, ANN, CNN models I learned from practice 

First is NLP, where I convert data from the Restaurant_Reviews.tsv using the nltk package in Python. 
Using the Naive Bayes Classifier we look at sentiment of restauurant reviews. Negative reviews are denoted as 0. Positive reviews are denoted as 1. We train the model to see how well it can predict positive and negative reviews in the test set. Using the confusion matrix to determine the accuracy of prediction.

Second is ANN, using the Churn Modelling.csv dataset to create an imput layer, hidden layer and output layer. Making predictions and observing the accuracy using confusion matrix.  

Third is CNN, using training set of images of cats and dogs we train the CNN to predict the test images of cat and dog. This is a classification excercise using image recognition. We use Keras deep learning package to do CNN in this case.
